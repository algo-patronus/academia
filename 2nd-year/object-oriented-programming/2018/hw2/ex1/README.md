Prime numbers are natural numbers divisible only by 1 and themselves.

a) Create a function that will test if the passed number is prime.
   If a given number is less than 1, a function shall generate std::invalid argument exception.
   bool isPrime(int);

b) Write a function that return first n prime numbers.
   std::vector<int> primes(int);

c) Write a program that writes a sum of the first 300000 prime numbers on the output.

Note:
While evaluating a sum of prime numbers, calculation of big numbers will become more complex.
Pay attention to the algorithm that checks if the number is prime.
Is it necessary to check all the numbers [1 - n]?
Which range is sufficient?
